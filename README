These are my attempts at solving the ProjectEuler problems. They are by no
means the best or most concise solutions, but instead whatever (a) popped into
my head first and (b) actually got the correct answer.

I don't go back and edit the original solution once I get the correct answer
for the purpose of demonstrating my organic thinking in the languages I use. It
is especially true that Haskell allows a level of compression and concision
that is directly proportional to the skill and intelligence of the coder, so my
more verbose solutions are offered as evidence of this continuum.
